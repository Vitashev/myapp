1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,800
So if a photon is directed
through a plane with two slits in it

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,500
and either slit is observed,
it will not go through both slits.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
If it's unobserved, it will.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,100
However, if it's observed
after it's left the plane

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
but before it hits its target,
it won't have gone through both slits.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Agreed.
What's your point?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
There's no point, I just think
it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,700
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,700
One across is "Aegean."

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Eight down is "Nabokov."

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,700
26 across is "MCM."

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
14 down is...
Move your finger...

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
"Phylum" which makes 14 across
"Port-au-Prince"

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
See, "Papa Doc's capitol idea,"
that's "Port-au-Prince."

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Haiti.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,600
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
I think this is the place.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,100
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,300
- We'll be right back.
- Take your time.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,600
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,200
Oh, wait.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,900
What, are you kidding?
You're a semi-pro.

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,500
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,800
There's no guarantee that our sperm
is going to generate high-IQ offspring.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,800
Think about that. I have a sister with
the same basic DNA mix

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,400
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,700
Sheldon, this was your idea.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,000
A little extra money to get fractional
T-1 bandwidth in the apartment.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,000
I know, and I do yearn
for faster downloads.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
But there's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,200
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,700
an integral or a differential
to solve the area under a curve?

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,000
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
Well, what do you want to do?

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I want to leave.

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,900
What's the protocol for leaving?

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,500
I don't know... I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,500
Let's try just walking out.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,900
- Bye.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.
